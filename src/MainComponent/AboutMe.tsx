        <p>
          Hi, I'm <span className="font-semibold text-white">Laurentiu Lupsa</span>, a <span className="text-white font-semibold">Full Stack Web Developer</span>. I'm passionate about technology, web development, and building real solutions that make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm highly adaptable, a strong communicator, and actively engaged in every project, whether solo or as part of a team. I stay up to date with the latest technologies and best practices, always eager to learn and grow with every new challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring design concepts, laughing with my friends on Discord or even going on a hike in the Carpathian Mountains. I'm always open to new collaborations, exciting projects, and fresh ideas!
